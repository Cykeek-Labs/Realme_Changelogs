=== October Changes ===

Enabled qcrild & data services on boot
Added Pixel 7 pro CTS Fingerprint [ google/cheetah/cheetah:13/TD1A.220804.031/9071314:user/release-keys ]
Reverted headphone volume [ Causing distortion in heaphone ]
Added optional Pixel Launcher MOD [ Depend on maintainer whther they want to add Pixel Mod version or not ]
Allow SystemUI app to READ_PHONE_STATE
set 50% Zram size
Enable 64-bit inode version support for ext4
Set max_comp_streams to 4 [ more results in battery drain and lags ]
Kang sensors.ssc from Nokia PL2 [ * Fixes deep sleep , knaged from PL2_sprout-user 10 QKQ1.190828.002 00WW_4_150 ]
Addres dolby denials
Optimized auto brightness adjustment
Tweak msm_irqbalance [ We should ignore latency sensitive IRQs from userspace IRQ balancing ]
Tune bmps listening interval [ Tune the BMPS listening interval for the moderate power level to achieve power savings during wifi idle ]
use clang-r437112b
Import extras for Realme 3 Pro [ * it includes : - MotoPhone - MotoGallery - MotoWidget - LMC Gcam]
Set default wifi country code and allow resetting
Wi-Fi improvements
Set Wifi country code to US [ enables 5GHz wifi hotspot ]
import Powerhint.json from Android13-release [ From Redbull Devices (Pixel 5) ]
Update Performance data for Android T [ updated values from redbull devices (Pixel 5) ]
Add tethering usb props
Set permissions for KGSL sysfs node
Add feature flag for FEATURE_IPSEC_TUNNELS [ it adds the IPSEC_TUNNELS feature flag, with XFRM Interfaces used as the implementation of choice ]
Declare EUICC permission
Enable IORap app launch prefetching [ improvements to app launch time ]
Use 64bit dex2oat on all cores
Add regulatory info label [ Depends on source side for this option ]
Removed More Gapps Bloatware and bring back GoogleChrome [think install windows and there is no browser how weird it gonna look
so why not repect android in the same way?]
Disable Intrusive gms components [these processes were not allowed to run in background and yet they still persist everytime causing logspam and unnecessary broadcast]
Added aptX support
bring back GCamGo as default and kicked LMC [ user can download it i hate bloatwares!!]

*** Kernel Changes ***
better Deepsleep now upto 98%
enable adrenoboost by default [ Set it to low powered mode to eliminate ui lags without having a high active drain ]
changes in strings [ added CYKEEK-BALANCED_KERNEL ]
Fix some logspam
Imposed some restrictions during CPU idle [ Reduces IDLE drain ]
Kill GoogleCamera in background [ Don't worry LMC Cam is safe ]
added support for LLVM's Polly optimizer
Minimize wakeup time
Disabled LTO
avoid dynamic allocations in sel_write-access [ better performance ] 
Reduce freeze timeout to 1 sec for Android
Disable RT_RUNTIME_SHARE by default [ better CPU usage ]
introduce simple low memory killer for Android [ better Ram usage ]
Disabled debug logging in other areas [ causing high cpu usage ]
disable EVENT_LOG in usb thanks to Mr.fox unkil :)
Added KCAL support
increase GPU and cgroup limit to 6 [more performance brrrrrrrrr!! fuck idle drain who cares]
use CLKFLAG_NO_RATE_CACHE [Better CPU management and deep sleep might be better]
Disabled I/O stats accounting by default
Disable random pool contribution by default
swap pages one at a time
Relax adreno spin idle tight loop [ causing RT throttling ]
Diable compaction of unevictable pages [Lets prevent these applications from having their memory moved during compaction]
Add cap_user_time aarch64 [ Better calculation in thread times which leads to low CPU usage ]
Avoid competing with low-priority tasks
move msm_ion_init to async probe [ Reduce Boot time to first stage ]
Use optimized memcmp [ Improves performance ]
update LZ4 compressor module [ Patch series "Update LZ4 compressor module", v7. ]
More log spam compressed 
Don't allow IRQ affinity masks to have more than one CPU [ Fix the IRQ affinity mask deception by forcing it to only contain one
set CPU ]
Fix mem leak reported by kmemleak 
Silence healthd messages from userspace [ Constant messages about battery status every second doesn't help battery or debugging]
enable support for TCP fast open on listeners 
Disable IRQ debugging by default 
disable tx and rx debugging 
Queue work on power efficient WQ
Silences WLAN, PCIe, and CPU suspend state kernel messages
Welcome Liquid [ by kartik728 ]
memory utilities optimization [ Optimize memcpy and memmove ]
Add more improvements in KCAL [ now FKM detect KCAL properly ]
